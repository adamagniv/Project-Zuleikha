My name is Or, I am in a relationship for the past 4 years, her name is Nina. We recently decided to move in together, it's the first time we both left our parents house. Since we moved in, we argue a lot more over stuff regarding the house. Last night she got really upset with me over the dishes and laundry she asked me to do.
